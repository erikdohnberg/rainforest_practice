== Rainforest Practice

This file was create to help cement and improve my skills with rails. Although I sometimes referenced old code (forked from my previous attempt making the app with a Bitmaker Labs classmate), this version of Rainforest was largely done by myself. The first several commits were done with a large group of classmates before I broke off to finish the app myself.
